# Employee Payroll System

## Description
This is a Java project that demonstrates a simple Employee Payroll System using object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and polymorphism. It includes classes for different types of employees (salaried, hourly, commission-based, and base plus commission) and calculates their payments based on their specific payment methods.

## Usage
To use this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kathleenforgiarini/java_payrollSystem.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).

3. Run the PayrollSystemTest class to test the functionality of the employee classes and payment calculations.

## Project Structure
- bus package contains the employee classes (Employee, SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee, ComissionEmployee, BasePlusComissionEmployee).
- client package contains the PayrollSystemTest class to test and demonstrate the employee classes.

## Employee Classes
- Employee: The base abstract class representing an employee.
- SalariedEmployee: Represents a salaried employee with a fixed weekly salary.
- HourlyEmployee: Represents an hourly employee with an hourly wage and hours worked.
- ComissionEmployee: Represents a commission-based employee with gross sales and commission rate.
- BasePlusComissionEmployee: Extends ComissionEmployee to include a base salary.

## Example Output
You can refer to the example output in the comments section of the PayrollSystemTest class to see how payments are calculated for different types of employees.
